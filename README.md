------
## Getting Started
This program requires you to have a api toke for the bungie api. This can be obtained by going on their website and registering an application.

After cloning the repository, you will need to create a file called api_key.txt in the directory where all the files for the program are contained. In that file, you will need to paste in your api key.

After this step, you can run the program by running destiny_api.py. Instructions will be displayed in the terminal, and everything should be easy and intuitive after that.
